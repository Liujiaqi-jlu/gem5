# See CONTRIBUTING.md for details of gem5's contribution process.
#
# This file contains a list of gem5's tags which are used to identify a
# subsystem or comonent of gem5. These tags are used at the beginning of commit
# message headers for commits targetting that subsystem. For example, for a
# change which modifies the ARM ISA and  the KVM CPU the commit message would
# take the form:
#
# ```
# arch-arm, cpu-kvm: <commit header>
#
# <commit description>
# ```
#
# Entries in this file conform to the following YAML schema:
#   tag:
#     desc: >-
#       Optional description of the subsystem.
